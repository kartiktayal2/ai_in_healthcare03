This project analyzes the COVID-19 global deaths dataset by reshaping it into long format, handling missing values, and converting dates. A SARIMAX model forecasts death trends for selected countries, while Logistic Regression on latitude and longitude predicts high- or low-death regions, combining data cleaning, visualization, and modeling.
